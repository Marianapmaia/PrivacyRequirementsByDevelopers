### Abstract:
<div style="text-align: justify">[Context and motivation] Ensuring privacy of users' data has become a top concern in software development, either to satisfy users' needs or to comply with privacy laws. The problem may increase by the time a new law is in the vacancy period, and companies are working to understand how to comply  with it. [Question/problem] In fact, research has shown that many developers do not have sufficient knowledge about how to develop privacy-sensitive software. [Principal ideas/results] Motivated by this scenario, we conducted a qualitative study with thirteen developers from six different private companies to investigate which personal factors affect how they perceive and interpret privacy. [Contribution] The identification of the personal factors that affect how developers handle privacy requirements contributes to the elaboration of effective methods for promoting proper privacy-sensitive software development.</div>
